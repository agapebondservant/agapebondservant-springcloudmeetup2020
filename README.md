## Demonstration of Spring Cloud with Consul and Resilience4j

### Overview
This is a *suuuper* basic Voter Dashboard app that aggregates real-time data from 2 separate teams ("Red" squad and "Blue" squad) and displays it in a visualization. The microservices collect voting data and send it to the front-end app via an API Gateway. To do this, it utilizes:

 - Spring Webflux for reactive web API;
 - Spring Cloud Consul Discovery for service discovery;
 - Spring Cloud Loadbalancer for client-side loadbalancing;
 - Spring Cloud CircuitBreaker + Resilience4j for circuit-breaking;
 - Spring Cloud Gateway for API Gateway.

Other enhancements that can be easily introduced:

 - Spring Cloud Config for externalized configuration;
 - Spring Cloud Sleuth & Spring Cloud Zipkin for distributed tracing;
 - Spring Cloud Rabbit for messaging;
 - Spring Cloud Contract for contract testing;
 - etc...
